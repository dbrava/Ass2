	<h1>MeetUps are here to help</h1>

	<p>WE must take adventures in order to know where we truly BELONG</p>
	<p>When finding yourself in a new place, the trick is to find others like you. People that share the same interests will have greater chances to bond and to have a better time. When I first arrived in NYC I did not know ANYONE. Scary? Yes, but that did not stop me from making many friends and that changed my life.</p>

	<p>Meet Ups groups are amazing for that. They are the best option to find something you are interested in and to help you find your group. You can find all the info right <a href="https://www.meetup.com/">HERE.</a></p>
